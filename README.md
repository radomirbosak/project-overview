Python
------
*	[My master's thesis](http://diplomovka.rbos.sk)

	As part of my master's thesis, I conducted simulations on echo-state networks (a type of artificial neural network). These simulations were written as python scripts.

	Partial results produced by this research were published on a dedicated site [diplomovka.rbos.sk](http://diplomovka.rbos.sk). Some of the scripts used are available there. To browse available sourcecode(s), click "all articles" on the bottom of the page (or follow this [link](http://diplomovka.rbos.sk/?a=all)) and search the page for the keyword "sourcecode".
